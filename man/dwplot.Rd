\title{Dot-and-Whisker Plots of Regression Results}
\usage{
dwplot(x, alpha = 0.05, dodge_size = 0.15)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either a tidy data.frame (see 'Details'), a model object to be tidied with \code{\link[broom]{tidy}}, or a list of such model objects.}

\item{alpha}{A number setting the criterion of the confidence intervals. The default value is .05, corresponding to 95-percent confidence intervals.}

\item{dodge_size}{A number (typically between 0 and 0.3) indicating how much vertical separation should be between different models' coefficients when multiple models are graphed in a single plot.  Lower values tend to look better when the number of independent variables is small, while a higher value may be helpful when many models appear on the same plot.}
}
\value{
The function returns a \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
\code{dwplot} is a function for quickly and easily generating dot-and-whisker plots of regression models saved in tidy data frames.
}
\details{
\code{dwplot} visualizes regression results saved in tidy data.frames by, e.g., \code{\link[broom]{tidy}} as dot-and-whisker plots generated by \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}}.

Tidy data.frames to be plotted should include the variables \code{term} (names of predictors), \code{estimate} (corresponding estimates of coefficients or other quantities of interest), \code{std.error} (corresponding standard errors), and optionally \code{model} (when multiple models are desired on a single plot).
In place of \code{std.error} one may substitute \code{lb} (the lower bounds of the confidence intervals of each estimate) and \code{ub} (the corresponding upper bounds).

For convenience, \code{dwplot} also accepts as input those model objects that can be tidied by \code{\link[broom]{tidy}}, or a list of such model objects.

Because the function takes a data.frame as input, it is easily employed for a wide range of models, including those not supported by \code{\link[broom]{tidy}}.
And because the output is a \code{ggplot} object, it can easily be further customized with any additional arguments and layers supported by \code{ggplot2}.
Together, these two features make \code{dwplot} extremely flexible.
