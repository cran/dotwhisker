dotwhisker
=========

`dotwhisker` is an R package for quickly and easily generating dot-and-whisker plots of regression results, either directly from model objects or from tidy data frames. It provides a convenient way to create highly customizable plots for presenting and comparing statistics. It can be used to plot coefficients or other estimates (e.g., predicted probabilities) within a model or compare them across different models. The estimates are presented as dots with confidence interval whiskers, and predictors can be grouped in brackets.

To install:


* the latest released version: `install.packages("dotwhisker")`.
* the latest developing version: `devtools::install_github("fsolt/dotwhisker")`.
